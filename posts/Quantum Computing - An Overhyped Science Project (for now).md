Quantum computing, much like fusion energy is a a field of technological innovation the exhibits a phenomenon where every 2-3 years they get a brief moment in the media limelight.

And well.... its that time again.

### Motivation
I just want to preface the rest of this article by saying that I have absolutely **no** financial interest in any of this. I am not invested in any of the companies that may be mentioned and I don't have any long or short exposure on any of the stocks mentioned.

If there is something that really grinds my gears. It's media outlets blowing up tech news *way* out of proportion by writing sensationalist posts about new developments in a field. As we saw in the last few months with quantum computing. As a symptom of many people being exposed to these advanced technical concepts; with the added ability to jump in on the hype by buying in on these companies through the convenience of their phone. There is a lot of misinformation circulating about quantum computing.

So lets clear up what quantum computers really are. What they can and can't do. And why they aren't going to make "AI faster".

### What is a Quantum Computer?
A **quantum computer** is a type of computer that exploits some *really* cool quirks of [quantum mechanics|Physics that focuses on interactions between individual particles at an atomic or smaller level.], such as [superposition|When a particle (system) exists in multiple states at once until measured], [entaglement|When two or more particles become linked so that measuring one instantly affects the other, at any distance apart.], and [interference|When quantume states combine in ways that amplify some outcomes and cancel others (just like waves) guiding probabilities towards a certain result.] - to perform calculations.

This all sounds incredibly complicated. And it is!
But the main thing to know is that it works fundamentally different to normal computers. You can think of it as preparing a bunch of special quantum bits (qubits) that explore many possible solutions at once, and then, using clever tricks, extracting the right answer from all those possibilities.

### Is a Quantum Computer actually useful?
In short: yes. However there is more nuance to this than Google, IBM, Microsoft and every major tech media outlet would have you believe. Quantum computers are very good at very specific problems that take very long to run on traditional computers, but have some algorithm that can take advantage of all these quirks to make the algorithm **not** run faster but **scale** more efficiently.

In computer science, there is the concept of [Algorithm Complexity|This measures how the resources an algorithm needs, like time or memory, grow as the size of the input grows.]. Complexity is a very useful measurement tool of how good an algorithm is. You can imagine this like two people looking for a book in a library using different algorithms. The first one simply looks into the catalogue and finds the bookshelf where the book is and then searches that one. The second person just looks through all of the bookshelves until they find the right book.

If there were 100 bookshelves instead of 3, the first algorithm would still take the same time as there is still only one bookshelf to be searched. But the second algorithm would take about 30 times longer on average because it needs to search all of the bookshelves present.

The main goal of quantum computing is to run algorithms that on our current best computers with the best we can do, require us to search the whole library. But on a quantum computer would allow us to go straight to finding the right book. This is called **Quantum Supremacy**.

### Common misconceptions
- Quantum computers are **not faster** than traditional computers. Speed in computers is measured by the amount of "steps" or "cycles" they can do in a certain time. The fastest processors can run at many Gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) whereas the fastest quantum computers can only do on the order of Kilohertz or in the low Megahertz range (thousands or millions of cycles per second).
- Quantum computers need very special algorithms that suit themselves to a very specific kind of problem to work. This means that while they are *useful* in some areas. The market is much smaller than a lot of people realize.
- How fast "AI" is, is simply a measure of how quickly a computer can multiply numbers together and how quickly data can be moved from disk into RAM. None of these play into a quantum computers advantages. Is it possible that using quantum computers to develop some process in creating AI models becomes better/faster? Possibly. But that is also still a while away.
- Quantum computers are **not here yet**. No matter what Google would like you to believe. The currently biggest Quantum computing companies can manufacture processors with very few qubits, a hundred to a couple thousand
