Imagine having access to **millions** of dollars worth of liquidity for a few seconds. Make any trade. Do *anything* you want. Without having to put down **any** collateral.

That makes no sense right? How could that possibly work? Who would do such a thing? And why is this so exciting for DeFi as a whole?

### From the beginning
Loans or the act of lending something for something else is as old as civilisation. The first recorded loans we can trace occurred in ancient Mesopotamia around 4 thousand years ago.

>In early Sumerian and Babylonian city-states, farmers often needed seeds or food to get through until the next harvest. Wealthy landowners or temple authorities would lend them **measured amounts of barley** or silver, recorded on clay tablets in cuneiform. These tablets included the amount borrowed, the due date (often tied to harvest season), and the interest rateâ€”sometimes as high as **20% for silver** and **33% for grain**. - GPT5 (with some double checking on google)

Since then we have begun lending more and more. From mortgages to financing on cars. Even more recently the duration of these loans has gotten shorter and shorter. With services like Klarna or After Pay allowing users to turn almost any transaction into a loan which can then be paid off in small instalments over some time (usually a few weeks).

### DeFi Loans
For blockchain and more specifically, DeFi protocols, loans have been a difficult system to implement. Of course, there are many places where you can take loans. [Kamino](https://app.kamino.finance/lending), [Rain.fi](https://rain.fi/) and more recently [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/lend/borrow) allow you to borrow a variety of tokens or NFTs with one catch. You have to [overcollateralize|Overcollateralized means you must deposit more value as collateral than the amount you borrow (e.g., lock $150 to borrow $100).] your loan.

This makes it ineffective as a means to leverage your current money. Or in other terms, these loans don't allow you to buy more than you can currently spend. Instead they are used to earn yield generated by the interest on these lending pools or access liquidity without reducing exposure to the underlying asset. i.e. borrowing USDC against SOL to to have USDC to spend while still being exposed to the SOL as you will get it back when the USDC loan is repaid.
